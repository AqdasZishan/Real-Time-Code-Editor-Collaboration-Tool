Update 1 :  Now any valid class name can used for the class containing main function in java programmig language
            Previously, class can only be named as 'Main'.

Update 2 :  Also, finally is replaced with if statement.
            Now, "classpath referenced before assignment" error resolved.
            if statement will be executed only when there will be valid classpath 
            and the error in the execution, syntax or code will be now displayed in the result
            instead of displaying "classpath referenced before assignment".
