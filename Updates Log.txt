Update 1 :  [run_java.py]
            Removal of redundant code from run_java.py file.

Update 2 :  [run_java.py]
            Now any valid class name can used for the class containing main function in java programmig language.
            Previously, class containing main method can only be named as 'Main'.

Update 3 :  [run_java.py]
            'finally' is replaced with 'if' statement, resolving "classpath referenced before assignment" error.
            Because the finally statement is getting executed and looking for classpath to delete the files with '.class' extention although because of the error in the code, classpath was not getting created as compilation was not done and '.class' files are not created.
            And was displaying "classpath referenced before assignment" error instead of showing the syntax or compilation error.
            Now, if statement will be executed only when there will be valid classpath, and the error in the execution, compilation or syntax will be displayed in the result to the user.

Update 4 :  [run_java.py]
            Now, it checks for both valid main method signatures, that are, 'public static void main(String[] args)' and 'public static void main(String args[])'.
            Earlier, only code with 'public static void main(String[] args)' line was getting excepting and for the second case 'Main method not found in the Java file' error was occuring.

Update 5 :  [run_java.py]
            Now, accepts the cases 'public static void main (String[] args)' in line or 'public static void main (String args[])' also.
            There is space between 'main' and '()'.

Update 6 :  [run_java.py]
            Now, accepts all the valid cases of 'public static void main (String[] args)' and 'public static void main (String args[])'.
            There can be multiple spaces between the keywords and between and '(String[] args)' can have newline characters.
	    Now, it uses regular expression for find valid statement.

Update 7 :  [run_java.py]
	    Instead of haaving cleanup code in 'if' block at last now, it is in the try block for more robust error handling.
	    Earlier, if compilation error occured and '.class' files cleanup code is executed it gives error 'variable classpath referenced before assignment'.

Update 8 : [index.html]
	   Now, the run button is at top instead of being below code editor.
	   <pre> tags are added in output for better display of the execution result.

Update 9 : [index.html]
	   Css and overall styling is updated.

Update 10 : [client.js]
	    The code highlighting feature is fixed, the highlight changes with change of the programming language in real time.
